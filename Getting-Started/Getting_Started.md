## Getting Started

Getting started in tech is a process of learning, and discovery. At times it can feel like swimming against the current in open water, and other times it feels like riding a wave in a surf board. In this repo I will guide you from the ground up, so you can eventually fly on your own.

## Choosing a Path

A major decision before you get started is to choose a path. There are many paths in a wide variety of fields. Below are just some of them, there are way to many to list them all:

- Front End
- Back End
- Full Stack (Both Frond and Back End)
- Mobile Apps
- Database
- Machine Learning
- Data Mining
- Games
- 10X Engineer :)

## Education

For me education came in a form of self taught. I joined the Navy after High School and didn't plan to attend college in fact I didn't take any SAT test or any other test in preparation for college (Looking back that was a mistake!). I actually never envisioned doing anything in tech, I wanted to be a Special Forces Operator but that didn't pan out due to my horrible swimming skills, yeah I know the irony of joining the Navy. My career in the Navy was in Electronics/Electricity so not much of a career in the sense of conventional tech career. Though my solving skills did transferred well into tech.

Below are some of the paths of learning and education you can take (Not in any order):

- College
- Bootcamp (In tech, not military)
- Self taught
- Company Sponsored (Is that a thing?)

## Discovery and Experimentation

It can be daunting in the beginning on where to start. Sometimes you have to take a leap, watch a youtube video, or read a book and see if is something you'd like to do. Definitely experiment and finding out on your own what you like, everyone is different and thinks different, so what might be fun for someone might not be necessarily fund for another person.

## Side Projects

Theory can only take you so far, I am a firm believer that creating something out of scratch will take you to the next level. In the beginning you will create projects by following a tutorial, or perhaps your college course. You only need bare basics to get started, and do not read a book from front to back to get started on a project.

For me projects have to be driven by my needs (this idea came to me much like Linus and team created git), you have that connection and subsequently it fuels the motivation to complete it. You might be different and might have an idea for an app for the community.
