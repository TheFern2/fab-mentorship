    "# Introduction to JavaScript\n",
    "\n",
    "First things first, JavaScript is not a child or has any direct relationship to Java many of the same principle carry over but the syntax of the two is very different. Every language has rules, some more than others. These rules are known as **Lexical Structure**. I will attempt to keep this short, since these things will come to you quickly as you learn the language but I'd like to talk about them in case this is your first programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Case Sensitivity\n",
    "\n",
    "Case sensitivity is sort of a unspoken rule, and personal preference in some languages. Other languages encourage one over the other such as python (under_scores). The project guidelines can also dictate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "camelCase:\n",
    "```\n",
    "var myVar = 5\n",
    "var anotherVar = \"Hello\"\n",
    "```\n",

    "## Whitespace\n",
    "\n",
    "Whitespace is ignored by the compiler, in other words it will not matter how much whitespace you leave in between statements. The whitespace is mainly used for human readibility, the computer doesn't care one way or another.\n",
